# Film Query Project

This Film Query Project is designed to simulate a film database application, wherein a user can search for various details from a list of films, and that information is pulled from a database and manipulated to create a desirable user output.

## Overview

This is a Java Application that incorporates user commands with SQL commands. It consists of several object classes like Film and Actor, and through a Database Accessor Object it sends user requests and puts out corresponding information to the user.

### Technologies Used
Java, SQL, MAMP, Interfaces, Super and Sub Classes, Reading Database information

### How to Run
This application will need to be run in Eclipse through the FilmQueryApp. Select to Run as Java Application and follow menu prompts from the console. Enter the number next to the action you would like to perform, followed by the corresponding ID related to the menu option you selected, and Java navigates the rest; the application will display a list of information depending on what was entered. This includes everything from a list of films and their language/cast members to a single actor pulled from SQL by their ID. The user is able to utilize the application until they choose to exit.

## Lessons Learned
This project was a huge lesson in making use of database information, and translating that information into an output that the user can understand and utilize. I am continuing to streamline the story my code can tell.
